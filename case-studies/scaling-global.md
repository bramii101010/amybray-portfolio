## 🌍 Scaling Global Contingent Workforce  
## 📌 Problem  
Managing 1,000+ contingent workers across 20+ countries created compliance risk, vendor complexity, and financial inefficiencies. No standardized processes existed, and system/vendor transitions risked payroll disruptions.  

---

## ⚙️ Solution  

I designed and documented the **end-to-end contingent workforce process**, connecting onboarding, compliance, EOR vendors, clients, and finance:  

- **Onboarding Coordination**  
  - Added workers to EOR systems (SharePoint → later automation).  
  - Guided clients and workers through Upwork account + contract setup.  
  - Ensured correct EOR agency assignment in OBO.  

- **Contract & Payroll Setup**  
  - Managed contract acceptance on behalf of EORs and recorded IDs for billing.  
  - Paused contracts to prevent duplicate time entry.  
  - Uploaded payroll reports into OBO, triggering:  
    - Client Billing  
    - Vendor Payments  
    - Company Revenue Cut  

- **Financial Controls**  
  - Oversaw $1.2M+ weekly flows.  
  - Performed shortfall “true-ups” to ensure vendor accounts were fully funded.  
  - Built forecasting tools to align finance planning.  

- **Compliance & Vendor Governance**  
  - Acted as liaison between compliance, sales, clients, workers, and EORs.  
  - Migrated contractors during the Elance–oDesk merger with zero disruption.  

- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  - Built GSV dashboards for weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual tracking.  
  - Delivered forecasts within 1% variance year-over-year.

## 📈 Results  

- Scaled program to 1,000+ contractors across 20+ countries.  
- Reduced compliance errors by 40%.  
- Maintained payroll continuity with no vendor payment disruptions.  
- Delivered accurate financial forecasting, strengthening executive planning.  
- Established repeatable processes still in use years later.

## 💡 Business Value  

For organizations scaling globally, this program demonstrated how to:  
- **Reduce Risk** with standardized compliance & payroll workflows.  
- **Protect Continuity** during mergers and vendor transitions.  
- **Safeguard Funds** with shortfall prevention and controls.  
- **Enable Growth** with scalable infrastructure and accurate forecasting.
