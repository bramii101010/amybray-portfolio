💵 Payroll Migration

📌 Problem

A global Employer of Record (EOR) provider had no in-house U.S. payroll function. Without established workflows, systems, or compliance structures, the organization faced:

Risk of payroll errors and non-compliance with federal/state regulations.

No scalable processes to onboard or pay employees in the U.S.

High dependency on manual workarounds.

⚙️ Solution

I was brought in to build U.S. payroll operations from the ground up:

System Setup

Migrated payroll into the company’s systems where no U.S. payroll function previously existed.

Partnered cross-functionally with HR, Finance, and Legal to align compliance workflows.

Process Design

Created payroll workflows that covered onboarding, time/attendance, and pay cycle execution.

Documented compliance checkpoints for multi-state requirements.

Execution & Governance

Processed payroll for 500+ U.S. employees with accuracy and timeliness.

Implemented error-checking protocols to reduce manual discrepancies.

📈 Results

Successfully launched and scaled U.S. payroll for 500+ employees.

Ensured compliance with federal and state-specific payroll requirements.

Reduced payroll errors and manual interventions.

Built sustainable payroll processes that supported future growth.

💡 Business Value

This project demonstrated how to:

Stand up a new payroll function from scratch with compliance-first design.

Safeguard accuracy in high-volume payroll environments.

Enable scalability by creating workflows and documentation that remain repeatable.
