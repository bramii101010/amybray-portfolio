## üìå Problem  
Manual onboarding, mid-assignment, and offboarding processes were spread across Smartsheets and Zendesk. This created:  
- Delays in onboarding-to-payroll cycle time.  
- Errors due to duplicate data entry.  
- Heavy reliance on IT for every field mapping and automation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution  
I became the **front office Bullhorn owner** during implementation and migration, ensuring it was built to support the Talent Engagement team:  

- **System Ownership**  
  - Learned Bullhorn front office configuration, including **field mapping** and **workflow automation**.  
  - Built automations independently, removing reliance on the single IT resource.  

- **Cross-Functional Partnership**  
  - Partnered with IT, Engineering, and the Bullhorn vendor team to configure data capture and integrations.  
  - Restricted edit access for non-critical teams to **protect data integrity**.  

- **Process Optimization**  
  - Transitioned all onboarding, mid-assignment, and offboarding workflows into Bullhorn.  
  - Ensured Talent Engagement could self-serve edits while other teams had controlled visibility.

## üìà Results  
- **Reduced onboarding-to-payroll cycle time** by streamlining data capture.  
- **Improved accuracy & compliance** with better access controls.  
- **Removed IT bottlenecks** by enabling the team to manage workflows and automations directly.  
- **Enabled scalability** as onboarding volume grew without adding new bottlenecks.

## üí° Business Value  
This project demonstrated how to:  
- **Align HRIS implementations with business workflows** instead of forcing workarounds.  
- **Enable People Ops teams** to operate independently of IT.  
- **Safeguard compliance** by managing access and field-level edits.  
- **Deliver measurable time savings** and accuracy improvements in onboarding.
