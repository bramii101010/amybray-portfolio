  Bringing AI + engagement together in one platform
</p>

## üìå Problem  
Employee engagement solutions are often fragmented across multiple tools ‚Äî surveys, kudos apps, onboarding trackers, chatbots ‚Äî leaving HR leaders without a central system for visibility and scale.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution  
I designed and built **AuniConnect**, a Flask-based HR tech prototype that unifies engagement into a single platform:  

- **AI Chatbot (Aunikah)**  
  - Answers FAQs and provides policy guidance.  
  - Escalates questions to admins when needed.  
  - Tailors responses based on employee type (W2, 1099, direct hire).  

- **Recognition & Engagement**  
  - Kudos Wall for peer-to-peer recognition.  
  - Weekly challenges and engagement prompts.  
  - Tags to track core values like teamwork and creativity.  

- **Admin Dashboards**  
  - Manage employee data (employment type, EOR, assignment dates).  
  - Track recognition trends and engagement stats.  
  - Access compliance-related info in one place.  

- **Tech Stack**  
  - Flask + JSON storage (lightweight HRIS simulation).  
  - Streamlit prototypes for analytics (AccuAI integration).  
  - Python automations for chat history, recognition tracking, and escalations.

## üìà Results  
- **Innovation Demo**: Showcases how AI and HRIS concepts can be combined in a working prototype.  
- **Engagement Visibility**: Provides recognition stats and employee activity data.  
- **Scalable Foundation**: Built to expand into Salesforce, Workday, or ADP integrations.  
- **Portfolio Value**: Demonstrates HRIS and AI innovation for People Ops leaders.

## üí° Business Value  
AuniConnect demonstrates how People Ops and AI can work together to:  
- Boost engagement through recognition and challenges.  
- Automate routine Q&A while keeping admins in control.  
- Centralize engagement data into one platform.  
- Build a foundation for the next generation of AI-powered HRIS solutions.
