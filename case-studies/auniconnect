  Bringing AI + engagement together in one platform
</p>

## üìå Problem  
Employee engagement solutions are often fragmented across multiple tools (chat, kudos, surveys, onboarding), making it difficult for People Ops leaders to track and scale engagement consistently.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution  
I designed and built **AuniConnect**, a Flask-based HR tech prototype that unifies engagement into one place:  

- **AI Chatbot (Aunikah)**  
  - Answers FAQs and provides policy guidance.  
  - Escalates questions to admins when needed.  
  - Detects employee type (W2, 1099, direct hire) for tailored responses.  

- **Recognition & Engagement**  
  - Kudos Wall for peer-to-peer recognition.  
  - Weekly challenges and engagement prompts.  
  - Tags to track organizational values (e.g., teamwork, creativity).  

- **Admin Dashboards**  
  - Manage employee data (employment type, EOR, assignment dates).  
  - Track recognition trends and engagement stats.  
  - Access compliance-related info in one view.  

- **Tech Stack**  
  - Flask + JSON storage (lightweight HRIS simulation).  
  - Streamlit prototypes for analytics (e.g., AccuAI integration).  
  - Python automations for chat history, recognition tracking, and escalations.

## üìà Results  
- **HR Tech Innovation Demo**: Demonstrates how AI and HRIS concepts combine for real-world engagement solutions.  
- **Engagement Visibility**: Provides recognition stats and employee activity data.  
- **Scalable Foundation**: Prototype can expand into full HRIS integrations (Salesforce, Workday, ADP).  
- **Portfolio Value**: Serves as a showcase of my ability to design and implement people-focused AI solutions.

## üí° Business Value  
AuniConnect shows how HR and AI can work together to:  
- Boost engagement with recognition and challenges.  
- Automate policy Q&A while keeping admins in the loop.  
- Centralize employee engagement data into one platform.  
- Serve as a foundation for AI-powered HRIS innovation.
