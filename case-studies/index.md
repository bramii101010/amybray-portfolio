## 🛡️ AccuAI – AI Accounting Assistant  

**📌 Problem**  
Accounting teams regularly handle **sensitive financial data** (SSNs, account numbers, employee emails) while also facing risks from **duplicate payments, negative transactions, and unusual patterns** that can slip through manual reviews.  

- **Privacy Risk**: Exposing personal identifiers in audit or vendor reports  
- **Compliance Risk**: Not meeting SOC2, GDPR, or HIPAA data handling requirements  
- **Financial Risk**: Fraud or payment errors leading to leakage and audit findings  

Traditional tools focus either on redaction or analysis, but not both in real time.

**⚙️ Solution**  
I designed and built **AccuAI**, a **privacy-first Streamlit application** that demonstrates how AI can be applied directly to accounting workflows.  

**Key Features:**  
- 🔐 **PII Detection & Redaction**

- ⚠️ **Anomaly Detection**  
  - Flags duplicate vendor payments  
  - Detects statistical outliers (via IQR)  
  - Highlights negative and unusual transaction patterns  

- 📊 **Instant Analytics**  
  - Generates summary statistics (totals, averages, min/max)  
  - Interactive visualizations (distribution histograms, boxplots)  
  - Side-by-side “Original vs Cleaned Data” view  

- ✅ **Usability**
