## 🛡️ AccuAI – AI Accounting Assistant  
**📌 Problem**  
Accounting teams regularly handle sensitive **financial data**  (SSNs, account numbers, employee emails) while also facing risks from **duplicate payments, negative transactions, and unusual patterns** that can slip through manual reviews.  

- **Privacy Risk**: Exposing personal identifiers in audit or vendor reports  
- **Compliance Risk**: Not meeting SOC2, GDPR, or HIPAA data handling requirements  
- **Financial Risk**: Fraud or payment errors leading to leakage and audit findings  

Traditional tools focus either on redaction or analysis, but not both in real time.

**⚙️ Solution** 

I designed and built **AccuAI**, a **privacy-first Streamlit application** that demonstrates how AI can be applied directly to accounting workflows.  

**Key Features:**  
- 🔐 **PII Detection & Redaction** (SSNs, emails, phone numbers, account numbers)  
- ⚠️ **Anomaly Detection** (duplicate vendor payments, outliers, negative amounts)  
- 📊 **Instant Analytics** (summary statistics, visualizations, side-by-side “clean vs original” views)  
- ✅ **Usability** (simple upload → analysis → redacted file download)  

---

**📈 Results**  
- **Privacy Assurance**: Automatically removes sensitive identifiers before external use  
- **Error/Fraud Prevention**: Detects anomalies that cause financial leakage  
- **Productivity Gains**: Provides interactive analysis in seconds  
- **Audit Readiness**: Creates a clean dataset safe for external sharing

**💡 Business Value**  
For a **Chief Accounting Officer (CAO)**, **AccuAI** demonstrates how AI can:  

- **Reduce Risk** by ensuring sensitive data never leaves the system unredacted  
- **Save Money** by catching duplicate or anomalous transactions early  
- **Boost Compliance** with privacy-first handling aligned to SOC2/GDPR expectations  
- **Improve Efficiency** by automating tedious review tasks
